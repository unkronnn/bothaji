LagSwitch is a program that allows you to temporarily "delay" or completely stop data transmission between your game and the server. This creates the appearance of internet lag: your character might briefly "freeze" or "teleport," which can give you an advantage in various in-game situations.

You press one key - boxes reveal themselves, enemies freeze, you wipe a squad before they even blink.

Feature List:

- Enable Desync

On – The program is active and will create lag.
Off – The program is completely inactive.
- Sounds

If enabled, you'll hear beeps when the lag is turned on or off
- Keybind

The key you press to activate lag. Choose a convenient key.
- Method (How lag is triggered)

Temporary – Lag activates for a set time, then turns off automatically.
Pressing – Each keypress toggles lag on or off.
Hold – Lag is active while the key is held down.
- Traffic Direction (What data is delayed)

Outbound – Blocks data you send to the server. The server temporarily doesn’t see your actions.
Inbound – Blocks data from the server to you. You don’t receive updates temporarily.
- Protocol (Type of connection to block)

UDP – Used in most online games. Usually the best choice.
TCP – More reliable, but rarely used in games.
- DurationMs / DelayAfterMs (Used only with Temporary method)

DurationMs – How long one lag lasts (1000ms = 1 second).
DelayAfterMs – Wait time before the next lag can start.
- KickBypass (not needed in all games!)

Some servers kick players for excessive lag. KickBypass avoids this by creating several short lags instead of one long one. If your game doesn’t auto-kick for lag, you can skip this.

DurationMs – How long each mini-lag lasts.
DelayMs – Pause between mini-lags.
Iterations – How many mini-lags are triggered in a row.
- Randomizer

If enabled, adds a random number of milliseconds to each lag, making it less predictable and more natural.

Random Min / Max – Range of extra random lag time.
- Logging

Records when and how lag was triggered. Useful for testing/debugging.
- AutoRecovery

Protects from the program freezing or losing control.
If the lag lasts longer than the set time (AutoRecoveryMaxTimeMs) or exceeds a certain number of packets (AutoRecoveryMaxPackets), the program will automatically stop the lag and restore connection.
- Fake Lag (A special mode where the connection is interrupted in short bursts to simulate high ping spikes)

Infinite – Works until manually turned off.
Timed – Activates for a set duration and then stops.
- Additional settings

Block Min/Max – Duration of each short lag burst.
Pause Min/Max – Pause between lag bursts.
Total Duration – Total time the Fake Lag session lasts (for Timed mode).
You can also assign a hotkey (FakeLagKeybind) for quick toggling during gameplay.
